            This can be found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=DX_841432
            Please install this in a folder on your desktop or a location you can easily recall so that you can remove it after our test.

2. 
    After you successfully install Visual Studios Code please download our source files located from MyCourses.
    We advise you to export these files into a folder in a well know location so that you can easily navigate to the folder.

3. 
    Please start Visual Studios Code and select the "Open Folder" option towards the bottom of the page.
    Then after clicking, please locate the folder inwhich you exported the source files for Refu-Free.
    After Locating please open the project.

4. 
    For our test we will require the use of an Extension called "Live Server" we wll need you to install this locally.
    After opening the project you should be able to see a few icons on the left hand side of the page. 
    Please navigate to the small squares icon "Extensions" and click it.
    After doing so, please use the search bar at the top of the page and insert "Live Server."
    A lot of  options will appear, but we only require that exact Extension.
    Please click on the small button called "install" on the bottom right hand side under "Live Server"

    To do this we must navigate to the gear icon "Manage" at the bottom left-hand side of the page.
