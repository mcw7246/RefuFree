                    <p>Dear Refu-Free Community</p>
                    <p>Our annual tree planting event, Grow Green, is quickly approaching. Every Year since 1993, DHS members from all across the country come together to plan a day of giving back. 
                       Each year we team up with around ten of thousands of local companies in particapating cities to plant roughly one hundred thousand trees. We want to invite you to join us. 
                       Please sign up on the offical forums post under the socal category.
                       <br> 
                       <br>
                       If you need any assistance please contact Director Jeffery Gondon via direct messaging on Refu-Free's chat application.
